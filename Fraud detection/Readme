## **Optimized LinkedIn Post**

> Just wrapped up an exciting machine learning project on **Fraud Detection**!  
>  
> Built an end-to-end pipeline to detect fraudulent financial transactions using:
> - EDA, Feature Engineering, PCA, and SMOTE  
> - Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM  
> - Deep Learning: LSTM and CNN  
> - Hyperparameter Tuning with RandomizedSearchCV and Optuna  
>  
> Achieved:
> - **99% Accuracy**, **96% F1-Score**, and a high **ROC-AUC**  
> - Simulated real-time predictions and estimated net savings from fraud detection  
>  
> Tools: Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, TensorFlow, Optuna  
>  
> **Check it out:** [GitHub link here]
